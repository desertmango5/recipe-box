## Online app for creating, storing, and sharing cooking recipes

For years, my wife has used Evernote for storing her cooking recipes online. When they switched to their new payment structure, she began having problems finding her recipes (she was using the free tier). A search for _chocolate desert_ would yield unrelated results and frustrations. She asked me to create a new recipe app for her to keep track of her recipes.
